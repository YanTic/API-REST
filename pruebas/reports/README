Hi! I'm Julian from the past

I'm here just to tell you that when you're running the cucumber tests, always remember to
be in the /pruebas directory to execute any or all test. 

You can execute a single test by using this:

    go test -v steps/login_test.go

If you want to execute them all use this:

    go test -v ./...


So now that you know that, i want to tell you that each ".feature" has a "_test.go", and
each "_test.go" has a "func TestMain(m *testing.M){}" that allows you to execute the
tests. This function opens (in case if doesn't exist, creates) a file in 
"reports/reports-json/report_???.json". Each report has all scenarios of every test.
You know, this .json files serve to generate the report.html

When you have all the report_???.json files run:

    node index.js

to convert all the .json files to one .html

That command will only works if you run 

    npm install cucumber-html-reporter --save-dev

If you see all the project (maybe you're viewing this project on my github profile :) 
the node_modules/ - package-lock.json - package.json are ignored cause it's too much
(for github i guess) to uploade them. And the git commit lasts like 10 min. So I
decided to ignore them (best way i guess)

REMEMBER: If some test failed, maybe the token that tests are using expired. So go 
to steps/config-file.json and generate a new token and recoveryToken using postman
(That could be a TODO to automatize that)
